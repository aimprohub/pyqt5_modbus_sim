# pyqt5_modbus_sim
This is simulator for TCPModbus using PyQt5 5.15. This is first version and not fully tested. Python version was 3.8.3, may use any version above. 'pip install pyModbusTCP' if not installed before. 
IP and port value is hardcoded in the py file.
IP should be used of the server. Default port should be 502 but due to router restriction, used 8000. UI designed from Qt Designer and rest in python.
